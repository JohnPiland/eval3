<p>The strategy of the Greensboro Library’s website seems to be that of promoting patron and community engagement. Consistent throughout its content fields are resources and subtle resources that nudge visitors (primarily members of the GSO community) to become engaged, both in the library and in their community. With images of library-patron interactions, and a children' s play area within the library featured on the home page, the website subtly invites visitors to come to the library and use the resources within. Under the Services, Books & Media, and Resources banner are multiple links to subpages within the structure of the library website to help guide visitors to contributing to their community, from resources teaching anti-racism, to genealogical records. The front page also features a list of upcoming events with the dates and time.</p>

<p>The scope of the website is solid; it knows what it wants to do, and does it. It wants to reach out to the Greensboro community and does so A) through providing the aforementioned resources, B) through its organization of resources, and C) by keeping it on a Greensboro level, and not taking attention away to focus on the rest of Guilford County or the surrounding area. It is a site made by Greensborians, for Greensborians.</p>

<p>The site is well structured, opening the way to a smooth flow for its users. Hyperlinks in the drop down menu lead to pages with more categorized links and resources, or to detailed pages about the resource in question, making for an ease of access. The catalog is also simple and available at the top of each page, so users can search for something whenever they want. There is also a toggle to turn the catalog search bar into a website searchbar, so users can type in a resource they are looking for and find it directly, without having to sift through many different menus, links, and pages.</p>

<p>The skeleton of the site is concise as well. Most pages feature the main unit centered and slightly to the right, with side units to the left containing a menu of links to other pages within the website. The main page functions with a main unit that strategically pushes the library’s goal of promoting engagement. Below are two rows of containers with upcoming events, and at the bottom, a footer with hour for both the main library and its branches, as well as locations and contact information, having everything visitors to the site may need to know about accessing and contacting the Greensboro Library/Libraries.</p>

<p>Lastly, the surface is decorated with coherent colors, images quickly conveying various functions and services to visitors, and a background of a book, touch device, and glasses synonymous with a calm reading section. Together, the surface is made into an inviting image which encourages visitors to stay and check out the site. Together, these five elements make the Greensboro Library website into a functioning resource for library patrons, offering them the help they need at and away from the library.</p>
